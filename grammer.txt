In this grammar:

<program> represents a complete program.
<statement_list> is a list of statements separated by semicolons.
<statement> represents a single statement, which, in this case, is an expression.
<expression> represents an arithmetic expression.
<term> represents a term in the expression.
<factor> represents a factor in the expression, which can be an integer, a float, a parenthesized expression, or a unary operation followed by a factor.
<integer> and <float> represent integer and floating-point literals.
<add_op> and <mul_op> represent addition/subtraction and multiplication/division operators.
<unary_op> represents unary operators like positive or negative.
